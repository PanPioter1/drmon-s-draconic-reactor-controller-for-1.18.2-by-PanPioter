READ THIS FIRST

yes, the code is nearly 1:1 same as drmon's because I have no idea how to code in LUA. this readme is also coppied but with slight changes. the tutorial made by the mindcrafter still should be working but you have to copy a different pastebin code that's from me, edited to work on 1.18.2

WARNING

while the menu shows up and you are able to manage the flux gates, for unknown reasons auto mode isn't working. for now, use this only if you understand how the reactor works and know how to properly manage input and output of power or it will go kaboom real fast

monitor and failsafe automation for your draconic reactor

### what is this
this is a computercraft LUA script that monitors everything about a draconic reactor, with a couple features to help keep it from exploding
NB: This is for Minecraft 1.7.10. You will need to edit references within the code for any version higher to reflect any changes made to Draconic Evolution past its 1.7.10 release.


### tutorial
you can find a very well made youtube tutorial on how to set this up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rBhQP1xqEU) , thank you [The MindCrafters](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf2wEy4_BbYpAQcgvN26OaQ)

* connect a modem to your input flux gate (the one connected to your reactor energy injector)
* connect a modem to your advanced computer
* setup yoru monitors to be a 3x3 and connect a modem to anywhere but the front
* run network cable to all 3 modems

```
> pastebin get VhgTYcnG install
> install
```
